# Fog of War Research

Hello! This is Ignasi Pardo, a student of the Degree in Videogame Design and Development at CITM, who has been commissioned to carry out this small personal project in search of the creation of a functional Fog of War system.  

## Description
The objective of this project is to offer an easy and simple to understand solution on the implementation of a fog of war system on a tile-based map. 

Click [here]() to download the latest release, which provides two projects, the one containing the exercises and the one containing the solutions. You can also download the [source code](https://github.com/KuronoaScarlet/ResearchFogOfWar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
