# Fog of War Research

Hello! This is Ignasi Pardo, a student of the Degree in Videogame Design and Development at CITM, who has been commissioned to carry out this small personal project in search of the creation of a functional Fog of War system.  

The main goal is to provide a reliable, easy-to-use and easy-to-understand solution in C ++.

Click [here]() to download the latest release, which provides an executable with the final result and two projects, the one containing the exercises and the one containing the solutions.

## History: The Fog of War through time
### Origins
The word expression Fog of War comes from the limitation of the Field of View in the military conflict, the word "fog" expresses uncertainty in war and was introduced first by the Prussian military analyst Carl von Clausewitz in his posthumously published book, Vom Kriege (1832).
### First Games
At the beginning of the video game industry, developers thought about capabilities that they could not afford before, hiding information from the player is one of them, the first registered game that actually used the Fog Of War was [**_Empire_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH8eqPnSSEo) by _Walter Bright_. Another example is **_Tanktics_** by _Chris Crawford_. But this last one was criticized for its unreliable and "confusing" Fog of War system.

## Fog of War Game Concept
### What is the Fog of War in video games?
The concept of Fog of War is, in essence, a layer that hides the areas of a map or scenario that the players have not yet visited and that are therefore unknown to them. It is generally used in strategy or role-playing games, where they can move around the map in screen, in order to hide the enemy's position, treasures, hidden areas or simply, terrain. Even so, these elements are usually hidden again once they have left the player's field of vision. Therefore, we can differentiate 3 states of the Fog of War.
#### Parts of the Fog of War: 
- The Revealed Area: Field of view according to the player's position.
- The Fog of War: Translucent area that usually shows players the terrain, but where the items mentioned above are hidden underneath.
- The Black Mask: The completely dark area that has yet to be discovered by players.

### How it affects the Main Gameplay?
In RPG or Strategy games, the Fog of War plays a really important role in terms of gameplay, but it also offers players a greater experience and immersion when it comes to exploring the map, since it would not be the same to play Age of Empires knowing absolutely all the movements of your rivals, or it would not be the same to explore a dungeon of any game knowing the position of all the treasures.  This is how the exploration takes on a real meaning behind the screen, offering a surprise factor and the tension of not knowing what you will find when you take the next step, as a player.
### Are there different types of Fog?
Since the objective of the Fog of War is to limit the player's field of vision, it is obvious that the variety of different types and ways of applying this system is enormous. In many cases they tend to be very similar, but in others a single change makes the difference with respect to the other games, opening an even greater spectrum of possibilities. That is why the objective of this Research is to provide you with an easy to use and modify system, so that through your ideas and creativity you can adapt the code and develop a fog according to your game standards.
